# Investigating Trypanosomatid Infection in Drosophila  

## Overview  
Drosophila, commonly known as fruit flies, originated in Africa before migrating worldwide, adapting to diverse climates and environments, leading to the formation of various species. Due to their rapid life cycle, high progeny production, distinguishable morphological characters, simple dietary needs, and genetic similarity—sharing counterparts in 75% of human disease genes—they serve as model organisms in microbial pathogen interaction studies.  

## Trypanosomatids and Their Classification  
Among these pathogens, **trypanosomatids**—flagellated protozoan parasites—are categorized as:  
- **Dixenous species**: Require two hosts for their life cycle. Examples include *Trypanosoma brucei* and *Trypanosoma cruzi*, responsible for neglected tropical diseases like African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease, collectively causing over **60,000 human deaths annually**.  
- **Monoxenous species**: Restricted to insects, less studied, but first identified in *Drosophila confusa* over a century ago. Transmission occurs via contaminated food or cadavers, leading to adverse effects such as prolonged development times in hosts.  

## Evidence of Trypanosomatids in Drosophila  
Several studies have confirmed the presence of trypanosomatid species among Drosophila populations:  

- **Chandler & James (2013)**: Data collected from **four continents and Hawaii**, identifying **13 *Drosophila* species** from **16 sample populations**, demonstrating **high diversity of trypanosomatids** in these populations.  
- **Wilfert et al. (2011)**: Data collected from **across Europe**, identifying **five *Drosophila* species**, with **trypanosomatid prevalence ranging from 1% to 6%**.  
- **Kapun et al. (2020)**: Sequenced **48 pooled population samples from 32 locations**, used **MGRAST** to identify and count short protein motifs, and found trypanosomatids in **16 samples, with 15% prevalence across 262 million collected reads**.  

## Research Approach  
Previous studies (Chandler & James, 2013; Wilfert et al., 2011; Kapun et al., 2020) have shown that trypanosomatids exist among *Drosophila* populations worldwide. However, my study takes a **novel approach** by investigating **individual fruit fly samples** to determine whether trypanosomatids actively infect them.  

By replicating and assessing the **Kapun et al. (2020)** pipeline using previously collected data, I aim to **refine the methodology** before applying it to my dataset, obtained via **Illumina TruSeq paired-end sequencing**.  

If trypanosomatids are absent, the study will pivot toward identifying other microbial species present in the collected data.
