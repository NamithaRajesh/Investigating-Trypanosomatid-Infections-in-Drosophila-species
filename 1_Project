Drosophila, commonly known as fruit flies, originated in Africa before migrating worldwide, adapting to diverse climates and environments, leading to the formation of various species. Due to their rapid life cycle, high progeny production, distinguishable morphological characters, simple dietary needs, and genetic similarity—sharing counterparts in 75% of human disease genes—they serve as model organisms in microbial pathogen interaction studies.  

Among these pathogens, trypanosomatids—flagellated protozoan parasites—are categorized as **dixenous** (requiring two hosts) or **monoxenous** (restricted to insects). Dixenous species, including *Trypanosoma brucei* and *Trypanosoma cruzi*, are responsible for neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease, collectively causing over 60,000 human deaths annually.  

Monoxenous species, while less studied, were first identified in *Drosophila confusa* over a century ago, with transmission occurring via contaminated food or cadavers, leading to adverse effects such as prolonged development times in hosts.  

Studies have provided evidence of trypanosomatid species existing among Drosophila populations. **Chandler & James (2013)** collected data from four continents and Hawaii, identifying 13 *Drosophila* species from 16 sample populations, demonstrating a high diversity of trypanosomatids in these populations. **Wilfert et al. (2011)** conducted research across Europe, identifying five *Drosophila* species, with trypanosomatid prevalence ranging from **1% to 6%**. **Kapun et al. (2020)** sequenced 48 pooled population samples from 32 locations, used MGRAST to identify and count short protein motifs, and found trypanosomatids in **16 samples, with 15% prevalence across 262 million collected reads**.  

Previous studies (Chandler & James, 2013; Wilfert et al., 2011; Kapun et al., 2020) have shown that trypanosomatids exist among *Drosophila* populations worldwide. However, my study takes a novel approach by investigating individual fruit fly samples to determine whether trypanosomatids actively infect them.  

By replicating and assessing the **Kapun et al. (2020)** pipeline using previously collected data, I aim to refine the methodology before applying it to my dataset, obtained via **Illumina TruSeq paired-end sequencing**. If trypanosomatids are absent, the study will pivot toward identifying other microbial species present in the collected data.
